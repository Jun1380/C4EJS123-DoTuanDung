Ex 1:
Q1.
1.
- var : the keyword that tells JavaScript you're declaring a variable.
- const: that the identifier can't be reassigned.
2.
Var vs let:
- Var variables are hoisted to the top of its scope and initialized with a valie of undefined.
- Var declarations are globally or function scoped.
- Unlike var which is initialized as undefined, the let keyword is not initialized.
- Var can be updated and re-declared.
- let can be update but can't re-declared.

3.
Let vs const:
-the difference is that once you’ve assigned a value to a variable using const, you can’t reassign it to a new value.
-let can be updated but can't be re-declared.
-const variables can neither be updated but nor re-declared.
4. When we need to declare variables.
